My interest in programming started about eight years ago. It took me five years before I decided to take the plunge and do something about my curiosity. I have always loved Science and was previously a Registered Dietitian for my professional career. After working in health care and educating people on nutrition, I decided that education was the answer to everything. I got my Masters of Art in Education and became a high school Science teacher. As many do in healthcare and education, I started getting burnt out and exhausted from compassion fatigue and the demands of the work itself. Not to mention, getting burnt out from always having two jobs  to cover the bills. I also started to get this daunting feeling that if I didn’t keep up with technology, there would be a moment where I was left behind, either professionally or culturally.  Anyone with their eyes open, can notice that how the world is working at large these days has some technology behind it. It is imperative to understand how things work and the world around you.


I knew I had to make a change in careers and have always been interested in what ‘those programmers’ were up to. I guess I just lumped all programmers into my head as some kind of subtype from other professionals. Also, whenever I saw a screen full of code by chance or watched someone I knew program, I was typically very intrigued and wanted to know what it all meant. I decided to start dipping my toe in the technology world by going to Meet-Ups where you could try coding or talk with people in the industry. Like I mentioned previously, it took me five years of this, to finally decide that I wanted to actually take action and learn. For the longest time, I gave myself every excuse not to. The typical ones, like I was too old to start over or I wouldn’t be able to do it or that it would cost too much money. After awhile, I realized that if I didn’t even try, I knew I would regret it in the future. 

As a result, after doing my due diligence of researching bootcamps, I decided on going to Flatiron School. I feel that I have made the right decision because of the great community here in Denver. I most certainly hit some road bumps, but the instructors and facility are incredibly supportive and I am determined to finish the program and see what happens from there. I currently am in the online self-pace program, which seems to be a better fit for me than the immersive full-time program. I am very grateful for this opportunity to learn power tools and skills that can really make an impact in a company, at society at large and in my personal  growth. Learning these skills keeps me aware and always looking to the future with more hopeful eyes. As my best friend from high school and I would say when leaving Math class, “To Infinity and Beyond!”
